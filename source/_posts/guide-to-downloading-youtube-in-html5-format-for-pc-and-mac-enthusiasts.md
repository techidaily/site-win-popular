### About HTML5 Video

HTML5 video is designed to directly embed video in a web page by using video element to replace the object element. Before HTML5 video, videos are embedded in a web page by a third-party plugin, like Flash. HTML5 video can be supported by most popular browsers, like Safari 3+, Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 3+ and Opera 10.5+. Besides HTML5 video can support many file formats, like Theora video, Vorbis audio, etc. HTML5 video has become the future of web video. Compared with Flash, embedding HTML5 video needs less code and you do not need to build a custom player as before.
