### Restore Image with Norton Ghost

üëâ **Note:** If your computer cannot run Windows normally, you can use the Symantec Recovery Disk CD to help you boot your computer. Depending on which version of the product you have purchased, Symantec Recovery Disk is either included on your product CD or as a separate CD. If you don't have a floppy drive, you can create a [Norton Ghost Bootable USB](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) instead.

### Clone Disk with Norton Ghost

1\. Connect your new hard drive to your computer.

2\. On the **Tools** page, click **Copy My Hard Drive** and follow the steps in the wizard to copy the drive.
