Dear Yutaka,  
This is a feature request.  
Perhaps I’m overseeing it but is it possible to give a visual feedback on the interface for “Vertical Selection”? e.g. “Normal selection” vs “Vertical Selection”?  
Thanks in advance,  
Rien van Ham

Dear Yutaka,  
I get an exception “Ran out of stack space trying to match the regular expression” in this case:  
1: Search -> Find in Files…  
 2: Find: ^((?!<Landcode value=”NL”/>.)\*$  
 3: Files Types: \*.sm  
 4: In Folder: <whatever>  
 5: “Use Regular Expressions” and “Close when Finished”  
 6: Encoding: Configured Encoding  
 7: Output Options: Display Matched Lines Only  
Thanks in advance!

Dear Rien van Ham,  
If you mean the Sticky Vertical Mode, I added the ‘sticky vertical mode’ toolbar icon to the toolbar. It’s depressed when vertical selection is enabled.  
If you meant something else, sorry!

Hello Rien van Ham,  
What did you specify in the Search tab of the Customize dialog box: Additional Lines to Search for Regular Expressions text box?  
If you enter a large number, you might want to try with 0.  
Thanks!

Keymaster  
Hello Rien van Ham,  
Your regular expression:  
```  
^((?!<Landcode value=”NL”/>.)*$  
```  
has an extra ‘(‘ after ‘^’ and before ‘?!’.  
Can you rewrite your regular expression as simple as possible?

Hello Yutaka,  
Sorry, that was an error when I retyped the regex.  
It has to be:  
 ^((?!<Landcode value=”NL”/>).)\*$  
Thanks in advance!
