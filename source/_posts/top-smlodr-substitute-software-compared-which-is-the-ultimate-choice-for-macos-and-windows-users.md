## Top Smlodr Substitute Software Compared: Which Is the Ultimate Choice for macOS & Windows Users?

### Overview

SMLoadr is originally designed as a Deezer downloader to download Deezer music for free and without being Deezer premium member. Users only need to log in with their free account to download Deezer high quality music to MP3 or FLAC format. SMLoadr can work on Windows x64, Window x86, MacOS x64, some Android, etc. But I do not know since when users have reported SMLoadr not working. Some SMLoadr not working examples are listed as follows:

* I have updated SMLoadr, but when I open the updated SMLoadr, I only got a new SMLoadr window, not anything else. And of course I can not use SMLoadr to download Deezer music. Why this problem appears and is there a fix?
* SMLoadr stops working for me to download SMLoadr music. Is there a SMLoadr alternative better than SMLoadr?
* Since yesterday, when I tried to use SMLoadr to download Deezer music, even though I have logged into Deezer, but in fact it tells me to log in to use this script. How to avoid this problem?
* I have waited 10 minutes to download one Deezer music file, but the Deezer music has not completed downloading yet. What is the problem?

There are more other SMLoadr not working examples if you google and besides, some others complains that SMLoadr only supports to download music from Deezer and the supported output formats only includes MP3 and FLAC.

It is just due to the above SMLoadr not working examples and complaints that many users want to try a SMLoadr alternative. Now the following part just shows you the best SMLoadr alternative - Allavsoft.
